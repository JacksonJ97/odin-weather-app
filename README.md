# Weather App

Weather app built using HTML, CSS, and JS. Users input a city into the search bar and the corresponding data from the Open Weather API was displayed. An API function was used to get data from the Open Weather API. The data obtained and displayed were the city temperatures, current weather, wind speed, etc. A toggle button function was implemented to change the units to either metric or imperial.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JS
- Webpack

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to consume an API by using async/await and use the data retrieved for my website. I also reinforced my knowledge of ES6 modules where I imported and exported functions. I also learned how to import an external library such as date-fns and use its functions. In the date-fns library, I used the format function to format the date.
